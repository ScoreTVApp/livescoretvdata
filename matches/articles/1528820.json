After two seasons away, Leeds will desperately be hoping they stay longer than a year at the top table. Daniel Farkeâ€™s plan to try and make that a serious possibility has seen investment over the summer in physical players, ensuring Leeds can cope with what this division has to offer. The most recent man through the door, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, certainly has the capabilities of being an asset, especially because he cost them absolutely nothing. After missing pre-season, it would seem unlikely he will be starting in tonightâ€™s opener but we will see if he is called upon off the bench against his former club Everton. Everton supporters were potentially expecting a few more arrivals to add to the positivity surrounding new owners and stadium. It was a bit of a slow burner but Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish seem like smart additions, along with new forward Thierno Barry. The start of recent seasons has been surrounded with questions over whether the team can survive another year in the Premier League but under David Moyes, those fears have dissipated and they are finally looking up.

And that was exactly what happened against Arsenal, United starting fairly well, only to concede a corner and fall behind in inexcusably soft circumstances. Usually, AndrÃ© Onana is the man responsible, but in his absence, Altay Bayindir seized the mantle with alacrity. We can be absolutely certain that Ruben Amorim has already told his bosses he must have a new keeper and, though they have already spent heavily, the position must be addressed as a matter of urgency because if it is not, this will continue happening and they might soon be facing questions about whether a new manager is necessary. It is pointless building a swish new house only for the owners to knowingly leave the back door open, get burgled and sack the builder.
