Interesting to see that the whole narrative is now about Jackie boy (must have a good PR), a good job well done given his wasted years at the Etihad and drunken car crash. When actually the narrative is that, a year ago, before the return of laser-eyes Moyes to his spiritual home, Leeds would have seen this as a given three points welcome home to the promised land. With or without Grealish this will be a stern, laser-eyed test of their credentials.

And that was exactly what happened against Arsenal, United starting fairly well, only to concede a corner and fall behind in inexcusably soft circumstances. Usually, André Onana is the man responsible, but in his absence, Altay Bayindir seized the mantle with alacrity. We can be absolutely certain that Ruben Amorim has already told his bosses he must have a new keeper and, though they have already spent heavily, the position must be addressed as a matter of urgency because if it is not, this will continue happening and they might soon be facing questions about whether a new manager is necessary.
