The usual suspect Viktor Gyökeres was the star of the show, netting a hat-trick to bring his season tally to 34 goals in 29 Primeira Liga games, which is more than double his closest challengers in the scoring charts Samu Aghehowa and Vangelis Pavlidis. A vibrant start by the Lions was rewarded when the Swede poked home from close range in the 12th minute and the striker soon doubled Sporting’s lead with a powerful angled shot from inside the box. Gyökeres completed his hat-trick early in the second half with a thunderous free kick and only wasteful finishing by Geny Catamo and Francisco Trincão prevented it from getting embarrassing for the visitors. Moreirense pulled a goal back when Cédric Teguia headed in an outstanding cross from Godfried Frimpong and the visitors improved in the final half hour, but the result was never in doubt. Sporting go three points clear of title rivals Benfica, putting pressure on the Eagles ahead of their tricky trip to Guimarães to face Vitória tomorrow.
