This Jornada 13 fixture, however, will be no walk in the park. Saturday‚Äôs matchup pits the third and sixth-placed sides in the Primeira Liga against each other, with plenty of star talent on display. Vit√≥ria, currently sixth place in the Primeira Liga standings, come into Saturday‚Äôs match after an impressive 4-0 victory over Gil Vicente, and have managed 10 points from their last five matches in all competitions. Benfica have also been in fine form, accumulating a perfect 12 points from their previous four fixtures, including an impressive 4-1 win over FC Porto in November. Preview Benfica manager Bruno Lage, who is in his second spell with the club, has done an excellent job of reviving an underperforming group that struggled to find any consistency during the early stages of the season. Some minor adjustments to the lineup from the Portuguese manager have helped Benfica find a winning formula, and the Lisbon club find themselves back in the title race with plenty of games remaining in the schedule. A 2-0 loss at the hands of Famalic√£o in the opening week was cause for concern for Benfica. It was not until Lage took over on August 31st that the tide really turned for As √Åguias. Benfica have remained undefeated over the last 10 league matches, winning nine of those games. The club have secured 28 points from 11 matches this season and a win on Saturday would move them about FC Porto, and see them trailing Sporting CP by just two points with a game in hand. A dynamic attack that includes the likes of √Ångel Di Mar√≠a, Kerem Akt√ºrkoglu, Vangelis Pavlidis, Arthur Cabral, Zeki Amdouni and Orkun K√∂k√ß√º has been the key to Benfica‚Äôs recent success. Over their last four games in all competitions, the club have scored a whopping 16 goals. In the league, Benfica have recorded 30 goals in 11 matches. Over the 2024-25 campaign, 17 different players have recorded a goal for Benfica. The home side will likely field a strong side on Saturday but Lage will definitely have one eye on the upcoming Champions League fixture versus Bologna on Wednesday. Vit√≥ria SC have plenty to be optimistic about after a strong start to the campaign. Newly appointed manager Rui Borges has done a fantastic job of maneuvering through a tricky fixture list which has included 25 matches over four different competitions (Primeira Liga, Portuguese Cup, League Cup and Europa Conference League). Aside from a slender 2-1 defeat at the hands of Braga SC in the League Cup, the Guimar√£es club have been competitive in all competitions and remain undefeated in Europe. After taking 12 points from their first five league matches, os Conquistadores looked like one of the early favorites for a top 4 finish. A string of three consecutive draws to Casa Pia AC, Boavista FC and CF Estrela Amadora between the end of September to November, however, saw the club drop down the table. Over 12 league games, Vit√≥ria have accumulated 21 points after winning six, drawing three and losing three games. They sit sixth in the standings and a win at the Est√°dio da Luz on Saturday would see them overtake Braga and Santa Clara in the standings and move into the top four. A stingy defense has kept Vit√≥ria competitive over the first half of the season. Borges‚Äôs side have allowed just 11 goals over their first 12 matches and have secured five clean sheets along the way. Odds Benfica 1.28 , Vit√≥ria 9.50, Draw 5.20 Over 2.5 total goals: 1.55, Under 1.5 goals: 2.02 *All odds provided from Betano.pt. Odds are subject to change prior to kick off. Form Guide (All Competitions) Benfica: L, W, W, W, W Vit√≥ria: W, L, W, D, W Head-to-head Record Benfica and Vit√≥ria have met on 182 occasions in four different competitions over the years. In the Primeira Liga, they have faced each other 158 times with Benfica winning 111 games (70.2%), Vit√≥ria winning 21 times (13.3%) and 26 draws (16.5%). In recent seasons, Benfica have held the advantage, winning three of the last five matches and securing two draws. Historically, Vit√≥ria have struggled against Benfica and their last win against the Lisbon giants came back in 2013 in the cup. Players to watch Argentina's World Cup champion and two-time Copa Am√©rica winner √Ångel Di Mar√≠a will be the player to keep an eye on for Benfica. The former Manchester United and PSG star returned to the Eagles after a strong 2023-24 campaign and has been in scintillating form. The gifted winger seems to find goals when his team needs them the most, and currently leads the Benfica squad with nine goals in all competitions. He has also contributed five assists. Overall, Di Mar√≠a is averaging a goal every 125 minutes. Captain Bruno Varela will have to be at his best if Vit√≥ria have any chance of pulling off an upset in Lisbon. The Cape Verdean goalkeeper, who was a product of the Benfica academy, has been a rock in the defense and will likely have his hands full with a potent Benfica attack. Varela, along with a well organized back four, has already produced five clean sheets in 12 league matches and has allowed more than two goals just once in the league this season.", "cnUrl": "https://portugoal.net/club-news/4345-sl-benfica-vs-vitoria-sc-preview-odds-form-guide-and-players-to-watch-december-7?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://portugoal.net/images/VitoriaGuimaraes/Benfica%20Vitoria1.png", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1733507840078}, {"id": "pr:4275-a:964197", "ttl": "Preview: Benfica vs. Vitoria de Guimaraes - prediction, team news, lineups", "oTtl": "Sports Mole", "pId": 35, "sum": "Sports Mole previews Saturday's Primeira Liga clash between Benfica and Vitoria de Guimaraes, including predictions, team news and possible lineups.", "cnUrl": "https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/benfica/preview/preview-benfica-vs-guimaraes-prediction-team-news-lineups_559883.html?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/47/orkun-kokcu.jpg", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1733443651457}]}
