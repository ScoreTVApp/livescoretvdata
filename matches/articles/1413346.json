Roberto Martínez in particular took issue with one journalist, suggesting that if he is “suffering” watching Portugal play he should change profession. Bernardo Silva hit the nail on the head by saying “there is no middle ground in football” given the passion involved. Two-goal hero Franscisco Trincão, meanwhile, revealed that he has been encouraged to shoot more often both by his club and national team coaches. Roberto Martínez, Portugal coach “I think today we had a feast of football and that’s important. The Seleção is not for criticising the coach or to have a debate. It’s for us to be proud, to enjoy the players we have. Today we saw a mixture of generations: Bernardo Silva played his 100th Portugal game, Geovany Quenda was on the bench. This is a very, very special changing room. “I’d like to say that all the fans, the Portuguese people, should be very proud of this team. The first game did not go well, we accept that, but today we used the advantage of playing in front of our own fans to create a special atmosphere, which helped a lot. We played a game, that as the manager, I’m very happy with. “The number of players who entered the pitch showed the work we have been doing over these two years, not just these last two days, and scoring five goals is always important. I think today our performance was very, very good, and we completely wiped away our display in Copenhagen. A visibly irritated Martínez, no doubt stung by the harsh criticism aimed at him in recent days, was asked if he “suffered” while watching the game. He immediately asked the journalist if he had suffered, and the journalist replied yes. “You suffered? Well I enjoyed it. Because this is football. There are no easy games. Have you seen the other quarter-final games? Football is this. “Denmark played a good game. We were superior. But if you don’t like to suffer, I don’t think you should follow football.” “I can say that over two years we have lost two competitive games. And one was against Georgia when we were already qualified and first in the group. So in two years, 28 games, one defeat. I don’t think there are many national teams in the world who have achieved that.” Francisco Trincão, Portugal forward Francisco Trincão made a huge impact off the bench, scoring two goals for Portugal. Photo: Arlindo Homem © You had an amazing impact, scoring twice in quick succession after coming on… “Yes, I ended up being happy, but I’m happier because of the win, the most important thing was to got through. Whoever scored didn’t really matter. I’m happy because of the victory, the fans deserve it.” How would you describe the two goals? “I just had the chance to shoot. I have to shoot more often because I think I’ve got a good shot. They often ask me to do that, both at club level and here. Bruno said it to me just today. I think I have to take advantage of situations and shoot more times whenever the ball is near or in the box. I ended up having luck and scoring.” Do you think that from now one you’ll get more playing time for the Seleção? “I’m here to help. Today it was me, tomorrow it will be someone else, that’s not really important. We know we have a lot of quality in the squad. Anybody who plays can make the difference. We all have to be ready to play.” Have you spoken to your club teammates Hjulmand and Harder? “I spoke to them at the end of the game. Morten said that if someone had to score against them he hoped it was me, so he ended up being happy for me. No I hope they both rest well and are here ready for our next match.” Portugal will be playing Germany, in Germany, in the final Four… “Today all the games are difficult. We’ll prepare for it calmly. We have a lot of time until then, so I’m confident about what will happen then.” Bernardo Silva, Portugal midfielder Bernardo Silva played his 100th match for Portugal tonight. Photo: Arlindo Homem © Cristiano Ronaldo talked about unfair criticism directed at the Seleção. Do you agree? “Football involves a lot of passion. People who have been in football for a long time, like Cristiano and I and our coach, we know that when we win we’re the best in the world, but the next day when we lose we’re the worst in the world. There’s no middle ground in football. We are used to it; it’s part of the game. “Like Cristiano said yesterday, the most important thing was that we were at half time and we hadn’t lost anything, even though we played a poor game. Today the Seleção gave a great response.” As well as the right players, do you feel you have the right leader? “Yes, of course we do. I don’t know if you’re talking about the captain or the coach, but we’ll be with our coach until death.” Francisco Conceição, Portugal winger On the criticism aimed at the Seleção over recent days: “The critics are part of our profession. When things don’t go well, it’s normal, especially in a national team like ours, where the objective is to win everything always. That’s because we have a very strong team. “We won this game, which is important, but we have to win the next ones to win the competition.” By Tom Kundert", "cnUrl": "https://portugoal.net/selecao/4611-portugal-5-2-denmark-match-reaction-martinez-and-players-hit-back-at-criticism-trincao-admits-i-should-shoot-more-often?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://portugoal.net/images/Selecao2021/Portugal-Denmark-2025-Alvalade.jpg", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1742778984660}, {"id": "pr:9053-a:1270300", "ttl": "Portugal 5-2 Denmark: Seleção make Nations League final four after thriller in Lisbon", "oTtl": "PortuGOAL", "athr": "portugoal@portugoal.net (Tom Kundert)", "pId": 35, "sum": "Portugal advanced to the Nations League semi-finals after a thrilling 5-2 victory against Denmark at Estádio José Alvalade. Trailing 1-0 after a por performance in the first leg in Copenhagen, Cristiano Ronaldo won and missed an early penalty before Joachim Andersen's own goal gave the Seleção a half-time lead. Rasmus Kristensen equalised in the 56th minute before Ronaldo pounced to tuck home a rebound 16 minutes later. The tie swung back in favour of Denmark when Christian Eriksen scored after an error from Ruben Dias. The Danes tried to close it out in Lisbon but they failed, Francisco Trincão scoring in the 86th minute to take it to extra time, Trincão scored less than a minute after the restart as Denmark refused to go down easily, Gonçalo Ramos eventually sealing the deal in the 115th minute. The result sees Roberto Martínez's side advance to the semi-finals where they will face Germany in Munich. Early penalty Portugal were given an early gift in Lisboa where they were awarded a penalty in the third minute. Nuno Mendes’ cross towards Cristiano Ronaldo saw the striker brought down by Patrick Dorgu, Ronaldo stepping up and seeing his weak spot kick saved by Kasper Schmeichel. Mendes sent another cross into the box in the 16th minute, Ronaldo getting away from Jannik Vestergaard and meeting the ball at the back post where Schmeichel made a smart save. Denmark started to apply some pressure as the contest began to resemble the first leg. Their best chance fell for Rasmus Højlund who spun and saw his shot comfortably collected by Diogo Costa. Portugal square the tie Vitinha fired a left-footed effort over the bar before a deflected strike from Ronaldo instigated the opening goal in the 38th minute. Bruno Fernandes delivered the corner into the danger area where Joachim Andersen rose above Jannik Vestergaard and headed the ball into his own net. Morten Hjulmand fired a warning shot at the start of the second half before a Portugal counter attack ended with Francisco Conceição’s shot deflected over the bar. It was a sign of things to come as the game opened up earlier than most expected. Kristensen scores Christian Eriksen’s shot was deflected wide with the Dane’s equalising from the resulting corner. Eriksen sent the ball to the back post where Rasmus Kristensen was unmarked, the defender heading the ball into the far corner with the goal almost an exact replica of Portugal’s opener. The crowd were getting nervous as Roberto Martínez made his first move in the 62nd minute, Rafael Leão making way for Diogo Jota. Brian Riemer immediately replaced Jesper Lindstrøm with Andreas Skov Olsen. Three goals in 14 minutes Denmark were defending deep, inviting plenty of pressure onto their defence and paid the price in the 72nd minute. A long range effort from Bruno Fernandes hit the post and bounced off Schmeichel, the ball rolling to Ronaldo who followed up and who squeezed it home from a tight angle. Riemer brought on Mika Biereth for Højlund in the 75th minute and was repaid less than 60 seconds later. Rúben Dias had a horror show, his back pass intercepted by Biereth with Patrick Dorgu racing onto the ball and squaring it to Eriksen who couldn't miss. The end to end action was relentless as Portugal had a great chance to regain the lead, Fernandes finding Ronaldo who made some space in the box before smashing a fierce shot straight at Schmeichel. Martínez withdrew Diogo Dalot and Francisco Conceição for Nélson Semedo and Francisco Trincão, Riemer replacing the important Eriksen with 19-year-old Victor Froholdt. Any ideas that Riemer had of closing the contest out were shattered in the 86th minute when Portugal squared the tie for a third time. Schmeichel decided to punch Fernandes’ cross away instead of catching it, Mendes teeing up Trincão who made no mistake on his home pitch. Denmark responded with Dorgu heading Skov Olsen’s cross wide before an error from Gonçalo Inácio allowed Biereth to break into the box, the defender doing well to recover and divert Biereth’s shot wide. Morten Hjulmand’s shot was deflected narrowly wide as the contest went to extra time. Extra time action Less than 60 seconds after the restart Portugal took the lead in the tie for the first time. Gonçalo Ramos forced a save from Schmeichel, the ball falling perfectly for Trincão who steered the ball into the bottom corner. Jota put the ball into the net from an offside position before being sent clear by Trincão, the forward squaring the ball to Bruno Fernandes who saw his shot tipped over the bar by Schmeichel. The Seleção settled the tie once and for all in the 115th minute when Trincão combined with Jota once again, this time Jota’s cross picking out Ramos who converted from a yard out. What a rush! It was a phenomenal game of football that swung back and forth all the way to the 115th minute when Gonçalo Ramos eventually killed the contest. Football matches often open up towards the end of the second half, but this one was blown apart minutes after half-time. Once again Portugal did it the hard way to provide their suffering supporters with every emotion imaginable. Cristiano Ronaldo got some redemption after his early penalty was saved by Kasper Schmeichel. The 40-year-old collectied another award before kick-off, a trophy for achieving 132 victories in international football, a new world record. Nuno Mendes and Bruno Fernandes were influential and Trincão reminded many doubters of his class, scoring two important goals before Gonçalo Ramos bagged his ninth goal in just 16 international appearances. Bernardo Silva returned to the staring side and celebrated his 100th cap with a victory. This was the most difficult match report I have done and plenty of analysis could be added, many conclusions drawn. In the end it was an incredible spectacle, a true rollercoaster with Portugal overcoming a poor performance in Denmark to go through. The defending left a lot to be desired, frequently leaving opposition players unmarked from set pieces and individual errors being punished. Roberto Martínez will have plenty on his mind before his side travel to Munich to take on Germany in the Nations League semi-finals, the game to be played on 4 June.
