Wolves were unbeaten under Pereira and the superior side for much of the match but as they saw chances come and go, while portraying Gibbs-White as a pantomime villain, it seemed inevitable what the outcome would be. Nuno took Wolves into Europe and is plotting the same trick with Forest after a sixth victory in a row, sealed by goals from Gibbs-White, Chris Wood and Taiwo Awoniyi.
