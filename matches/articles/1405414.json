The Eagles controlled the game from the opening minutes, deservedly taking the lead in the 27th minute when √Ångel Di Mar√≠a played a 1-2 with Tom√°s Ara√∫jo and beat Matheus. Less than a minute later √Ålvaro Carreras got past a halfhearted Vitor Carvalho and drilled the ball into the net. The contest was basically settled in the 37th minute when Vangelis Pavlidis broke clear, his pinpoint cross converted by Di Mar√≠a. Roger Fernandes had Braga‚Äôs best chance shortly after half-time, their faint hopes well and truly extinguished in the 78th minute when J√≥natas Noro was sent off five minutes after coming off the bench. Benfica will remain in Leiria where they will face Sporting Clube de Portugal in the final. Benfica on top Benfica got off to a fast start in Leiria, Tom√°s Ara√∫jo heading Orkun K√∂k√ß√º‚Äôs cross against the bar. √Ångel Di Mar√≠a had a presentable chance that was blocked by Adri√°n Mar√≠n as the Eagles turned the screw. Bruno Lage‚Äôs side remained on top and went close once again, √Ålvaro Carreras dancing past three defenders and testing Matheus at his near post. The pressure was maintained and Benfica opened the scoring in the 27th minute. Di Mar√≠a played a neat 1-2 with Ara√∫jo, Gorby Baptiste unable to stop the winger who cut inside and found the bottom corner. Less than 60 seconds later the advantage was doubled. Carreras got past Vitor Carvalho with ease, picked his spot and drilled a low drive past Matheus. Benfica were playing with confidence and made it 3-0 in the 37th minute, ruthlessly punishing errors from Jo√£o Ferreira and Robson Bambu. Vangelis Pavlidis surged down the left wing and delivered a perfect cross to Di Mar√≠a who volleyed past Matheus. No way back for Braga Carlos Carvalhal made two substitutions at the break, youngsters Roger Fernandes and Diego Rodrigues replacing Gabri Mart√≠nez and Ricardo Horta. Braga had a fantastic opportunity to reduce the deficit shortly after the restart when Fran Navarro presented Roger with a great chance, the 19-year-old narrowly missing the target. Benfica rapidly regained control, Andreas Schjelderup getting past Matheus but unable to get the ball past Ferreira who made himself big on the line. Nicol√°s Otamendi saw his shot deflected over the bar before Schjelderup found Pavlidis unmarked, the striker converting from an offside position. Carvalhal brought on Jonat√°s Noro and Isma√´l Gharbi but the game had slipped away from the Warriors. There was no doubt about the result when Noro caught Carreras on the ankle, referee Cl√°udio Pereira watching replays on the touchine before showing the 19-year-old a straight red card. Akt√ºrkoglu tested Matheus in added time after some nice work from Jo√£o Rego, but it was job done for Benfica who advance to the final on Saturday when they will face a rejuvinated Sporting Clube de Portugal.
