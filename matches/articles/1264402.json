Hoping to be bedded in slowly, substitute Abraham Kanu was kept busy from the first moment as in-form Orient terrorised the Royals, particularly out wide. Joel Pereira was forced into the first save after ten minutes from Charlie Kelman’s low shot before Reading went up the other end and Harlee Dean’s floated header called Josh Keeley into action for the first time. Seemingly out-muscled and certainly out-paced, the Orient wide men had a field day and got plenty of joy out of Craig and Kanu. Reading grew into the clash as the half-hour approached, winning plenty of set pieces and quietening down the expectant crowd, but it was not to last. On 29 minutes, the O’s deservedly edged in front as Markanday grabbed his first goal for the club. Chem Campbell lost possession in Royal territory and a threaded ball found the winger past the defence. Cutting in from the right, he eventually powered an effort past the keeper. This came less than 60 seconds after the former Chesterfield winger found himself one-versus-one with Periera, but on this occasion the former Portugal international foiled the scorer. Reading had their chances, albeit less frequently than their hosts. The best chance of the half came for Andre Garcia, who is still yet to score. The 17-year-old dribbled from his own half and fed Sam Smith on the edge of the Orient box. The striker returned the ball and for a split-second the defence opened up, with only the goalkeeper to beat. Unfortunately, the chance passed him by and the youngster’s heavy touch took the ball into the grateful arms of Keeley. Charlie Savage had the side’s second shot on target of the opening half, but his strike from the edge of the box did little to test the in-form shot-stopper. Markanday had the final say of the half, but his intended cross caught the wind and forced Pereira to make a save and force a corner.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24885234.reading-fc-well-beaten-play-off-rival-leyton-orient/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/19015117/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1737825429572}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1099372", "ttl": "Reading team news: Noel Hunt makes two changes for Leyton Orient trip", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Reading boss Noel Hunt has made only two changes for this afternoon's trip to in-form Leyton Orient.
