Diogo Costa survived an early scare at Parken Stadium but proved influential in the 24th minute, the goalkeeper diving the right way to save Christian Eriksen’s penalty. Mika Biereth tested Costa and Eriksen’s shot was cleared off the line by Diogo Dalot, the Danes going into half-time full of confidence and maintaining the momentum after the break. Portugal had been playing with fire and were finally punished in the 78th minute. Costa’s pass was intercepted, a swift counter attack resulting in Rasmus Højlund finding the back of the net. Roberto Martínez has some work to do before the second leg in Lisboa on Sunday, his side too slow and too predictable against a quality opponent. Denmark on top The Seleção survived an early scare in Copenhagen, Diogo Costa kicking the ball straight into Mika Biereth before scrambling back to send the ball over the touchline. Pedro Neto drifted inside and forced a fine save from Kasper Schmeichel, but the Danes were proving far more effective in sustaining attacks. Jesper Lindstrøm’s shot was deflected wide by Neto and Jannik Vestergaard missed the target. Costa keeps it close Denmark were given a great opportunity in the 23rd minute when Christian Eriksen’s volley hit Renato Veiga's hand and referee Irfan Peljto pointed to the spot. Eriksen stepped up but couldn't beat Costa, the goalkeeper diving to his right and slapping the ball away from danger. There was no let up with Lindstrøm going on a long run into the box and scuffing his shot into Rúben Dias. Portugal had another spell of pressure but it was far too brief, Veiga shooting straight at Schmeichel and Ronaldo heading wide. Once again the hosts found gaps in Portugal’s defence, Biereth turning in the box and testing Costa who tipped the ball wide. The dangerous Gustav Isaksen then did well to deliver a cross to Eriksen who saw his shot cleared off the line by Diogo Dalot. The trend of the match continued in the second half, Rafael Leão going on a long run and finding Cristiano Ronaldo who couldn't control the ball. It's the Gustav Isaksen show Isaksen was on a mission in Copenhagen, his effort saved by Costa before pouncing on a loose pass from Dalot, racing clear and brought down by the right-back who was booked. Leão released Mendes who got to the byline but couldn’t pick out a teammate. Portugal were finally able maintain pressure for more than two minutes, Vitinha dragging his shot wide following Bruno Fernandes' free kick. Roberto Martínez brought on Nélson Semedo for Dalot in the 66th minute, Brian Riemer responding by introducing Andreas Skov Olsen and Rasmus Højlund for Lindstrøm and Biereth. Isaksen tested Costa once again and Eriksen couldn’t convert Joakim Mæhle’s cross, Isaksen returning to the spotlight when his shot was deflected over the bar. Højlund strikes Martínez made two more changes in the 76th minute when Veiga and Leão made way for Gonçalo Inácio and Rúben Neves. Two minutes later the Danes broke the deadlock. Inácio’s error had already presented Højlund with a chance that he fired wide, but the striker wasn’t so forgiving next time. Costa's pass was intercepted which resulted in Isaksen, Morten Hjulmand, Eriksen and Skov Olsen combining to tee up Højlund who slotted the ball into the bottom corner. Portugal ended the game with plenty of possession but no penetration, Isaksen and Jonas Wind missing chances before the final opportunity fell to Neto, his shot too close to Schmeichel. Poor performance Denmark fully deserved the victory which could have been more convincing. They ended with 23-8 shots including 9-2 on target, easily accounting for Portugal’s disjointed attack that lacked cohesion and ideas. PSG duo Vitinha and João Neves controlled midfield which gave Bruno Fernandes plenty of the ball, but Denmark were well drilled and dealt with everything sent their way. In the end it felt like watching Portugal at Euro 2024. There was possession with no end product, too slow, insufficient movement on and off the ball, and too easy to hit on the break. Add poor passing to the mix, and there is very little to be positive about. Cristiano Ronaldo had a poor performance but Diogo Jota, Trincão, João Félix and Geovany Quenda didn’t get off the bench. Let’s hope home advantage and the threat of elimination provides a spark for Roberto Martínez and Portugal who have to improve sharply to win the second leg.
