Selles on win \"I donâ€™t think it was a good performance from us. I expect more from my team. We took control of the game and scored the first goal, but we dropped our standards and conceded a goal. We scored a really good goal from Lewis Wing and entered a phase early in the second half where we went to protect, in a bad way, the result. We defended some situations and had some situations away from our goal and scored another two goals.
