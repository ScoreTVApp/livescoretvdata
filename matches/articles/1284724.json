The result was never in doubt from the moment man-of-the-match Fredrik Aursnes put the Eagles ahead midway through the first half, with a clinical finish after a fine team move. Andrea Belotti doubled Benfica’s lead early in the second half and the returning Ángel Di María celebrated his recovery from injury by coming off the bench to earn and convert a late penalty. It was a seventh straight win in the Primeira Liga for Bruno Lage’s team, with the free-flowing Benfica scoring 3 goals in six of those matches. More importantly, the win sees Benfica go level on points with city rivals Sporting at the top the table, with 8 games to go for both teams.
