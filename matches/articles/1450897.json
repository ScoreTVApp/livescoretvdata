Benfica came into the Champions League playoff second leg leading Monaco 1-0 from the first game in France last week, and despite a bright start by the visitors, when Kerem Aktürkoglu gave the Portuguese side the lead on the night midway through the first half the tie appeared won. But an enterprising and courageous Monaco, for whom Maghnes Akliouche was outstanding, had other ideas. Goals either side of half time by Takumi Minamino and Eliesse Ben Seghir levelled the score on aggregate. Pavlidis edged Benfica back in front from the penalty spot, but Monaco substitute George Ilenikhena scored seconds after coming off the bench to make it 3-2 to the Monegasques on the night and 3-3 on aggregate. With extra time looming, Orkun Kökçü proved the hero, the Turk’s deft touch turning an Álvaro Carreras cross into the net. A late Benfica penalty was overturned after a VAR check to ensure an anxious end for the huge crowd, but Bruno Lage’s men held on and the Eagles will play either Liverpool of Barcelona in the last 16. Sahir Bhojwani and Tom Kundert report from the Estádio da Luz. Positives and negatives (-) A strong attacking display from Benfica will gloss over Anatoliy Trubin’s atrocious performance on the night. Benfica looked in control after scoring first, but a costly mistake from the Ukrainian keeper saw the teams go into the half level. In the second half, Trubin failed to palm away what looked like a routine low shot aimed directly on goal from Ilenikhena. That once again allowed Monaco back into the game. Trubin will have to be better in the next round if Benfica have any chance of qualify to the quarterfinals of the European Champions League for the second time in three years. (+) Despite missing several of their key players, Monaco battled bravely. Adi Hütter’s side put on a fluid display that caused Benfica’s defence all sorts of problems. Maghnes Akliouche was the standout player on the night. The French winger was outstanding over the first three quarters of the match, assisting Monaco’s first and second goal. The 22-year-old’s dazzling display will have scouts around Europe on alert, and he will definitely be one to keep an eyes on in the future. (-) The Benfica midfield has been battered by injuries over the last few weeks and that was apparent early on in the match. Monaco’s front three looked comfortable slicing through the center of the pitch, with little backbone shown form Benfica in the middle of the park. Kökçü failed to control the pace of the game and was sloppy with his passing at critical stages of the game. The return of Florentino Luís will be a welcome sight for Benfica supporters as they prepare for a tricky run of games, beginning with Boavista on Saturday. (+) Knowing that a win or a draw would lead to a mouthwatering clash with either Barcelona or Liverpool, the 60,000 plus supporters at the Estádio da Luz were lively and energetic coming into Tuesday’s fixture. Following a difficult spell where Benfica gave up a second goal, there were some nerves from the home fans. In the end, however, a boisterous home crowd helped carry the player through a tense second half. More to follow shortly...
