The first five minutes was almost entirely played in the Royals’ half, albeit without threatening Joel Pereira too much. Experts at maintaining attacks and keeping pressure on the backline, Lasse Sorensen proved particularly key to the Terriers and ran Andre Garcia ragged. Running down the clock from as early as the 10th minute, Reading’s most noteworthy action of the early knockings was seeing Michael Craig change his boots after presumably underestimating the slickness of the playing surface. Pereira suffered with an issue with his collarbone, slowing the tempo down even more to the frustration of the home support. It took 23 minutes for the first effort, Dion Charles firing wide, but it kick-started a burst of action at both ends as Mamadi Camara went up the other end before thrashing over the crossbar for the visitors. Tawanda Chirewa should have done better after Garcia was dispossessed in the Terriers’ half, the midfielder missing the target from the edge of the box. Perhaps their best effort came with eight minutes of the half remaining, breaking from a Royals attack and nearly forcing a two-versus-one situation, Callum Marshall rounding the attack off with a weak finish into the arms of Pereira.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24920830.reading-fc-hold-huddersfield-town-goalless-draw/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18831769/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1739035057052}, {"id": "pr:2830-a:1144002", "ttl": "Huddersfield end losing run with goalless draw against Reading", "oTtl": "Press Association", "pId": 32, "sum": ".", "cnUrl": "https://www.livescore.com/en/native/news/huddersfield-end-losing-run-with-goalless-draw-against-reading-2025020817085196947/", "tnUrl": "https://image.assets.pressassociation.io/v2/image/production/6dd883a4d5071b12fb3c4c68810a3e7bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM5MTIwMjQ3/2.75502460.jpg?rect=0,53,8496,4779&ext=.jpg", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1739034221000}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1143539", "ttl": "Reading team news: Fan favourite returns on the bench for Huddersfield Town trip", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Reading favourite Amadou Mbengue has returned to the matchday squad for the first time since January 4 for this afternoon's trip to Huddersfield Town.
