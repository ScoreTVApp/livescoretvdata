Trailing by two goals inside 15 minutes through set pieces, Sam Smith pulled one back for the Royals on the hour-mark before Jack Diamond finished the scoring shortly after. Only a third home defeat of the season, it saw Dave Challinor's men leapfrog the Royals into the play-off places. Speaking after the game, Hunt said: \"We made it tough for ourselves. We didn’t start the game right, and we didn’t earn the right to play. We gave ourselves a mountain to climb with two set play goals, which we’re disappointed about as a collective. It was a bit out of character for us because we’ve been good in the last six or seven weeks with set plays. \"After that, we came in at half-time and started the second half better. We got a goal to get back into it and then the basics of the game: Be brave enough to play forward, we played it back. We don’t win a tackle, and we don’t recover or react, which costs us the game.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24867336.reading-fc-boss-issues-verdict-stockport-county-defeat/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18948266/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1737223849214}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1078025", "ttl": "Stockport County leapfrog Reading into play-off places with dominant away victory", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Stockport County leapfrogged Reading into the play-off places with an effective 3-1 victory at the Select Car Leasing Stadium.

Noel Hunt was able to introduce previously injured stars, such as Kelvin Ehibhatiomhan, Michael Craig and Jeriel Dorsett in the second half, one of the few positives in what was only the third defeat on home soil of the season. Despite kicking off with possession, it took Reading less than 90 seconds to be forced into their first defensive action of the half, a sign of things to come.
