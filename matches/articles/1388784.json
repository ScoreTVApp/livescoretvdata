Aston Villa - Tue, Sep 24th 2024, 20:00 Goals from Emi Buendía and Jhon Durán helped Aston Villa past Wycombe Wanderers to reach the fourth round of the Carabao Cup. On his first senior start since May 2023, Buendía broke the home side’s resistance when he netted a clever looping header after 55 minutes. Progression to round four for the first time since 2020 was secured when Durán won and scored a spot kick with five minutes remaining, rendering Richard Kone’s stoppage-time strike a consolation. Debuts for Joe Gauci and youngsters Kadan Young, Aidan Borland, Ben Broggio, Travis Patterson and Jamaldeen Jimoh-Aloba ensured it was a proud night for the Academy. Victory also saw Unai Emery become the fastest Villa manager to reach 50 wins, bringing up the milestone in his 90th game and overhauling Joe Mercer, who managed the feat in 93 matches. The two clubs had met twice before in the League Cup, with the last time seeing Villa emerge 8-3 victors in a crazy clash in Buckinghamshire 19 years ago. Emery made 10 changes from Saturday’s win against Wolves, handing debuts to Gauci and Young, with Sil Swinkels making his first appearance since an FA Cup debut in 2021. The red-hot Durán had a chance to open the scoring after just 37 seconds but slid a shot narrowly wide after latching onto Leon Bailey’s through ball. League One Wycombe had won five of their past six games and they threatened early on via Keiran Sadlier and Beryly Lubala. The tempo of the match slowed after an energetic opening, with the visitors exercising greater control but struggling to open the hosts up. Durán and Matt Butcher each sent an effort wide before the break as the sides headed back down the tunnel on level terms. Wanderers midfielder Butcher saw a shot deflected wide in the opening attack of the second half, galvanising the home fans behind Gauci’s goal. But their excitement was quelled when Villa netted with their first shot on target after 55 minutes. Young drove at his full-back on the left-hand side and reached the byline before pulling back a cross that flicked off a defender and on to the head of Buendía, who looped his effort beyond Franco Ravizzoli. Borland came on for his debut alongside Jacob Ramsey as the 17-year-old was rewarded for his strong performances in the Under-21s. Wycombe had struggled offensively since their exertions at the start of the half but they created two fine chances as the game ticked towards the final ten minutes. Both fell to Garath McCleary, who miskicked when he looked set to tap Cameron Humphreys’ cross home before calling Gauci into a five save from a header. Those missed opportunities came back to haunt the hosts when Durán won a penalty after a neat interchange with Ross Barkley, picking himself up to send the ‘keeper the wrong way from the spot. Broggio, Patterson and Jimoh-Aloba entered the fray late on as Emery gave a first taste of senior action to more talented Academy youngsters. Wycombe had the last word on the night, striking in the final minute of stoppage time via Kone. Upcoming Fixtures Ipswich Town Vs. Aston Villa - Sat, Oct 10th 2024, 14:00 Aston Villa Vs.
