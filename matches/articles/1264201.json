With their backs against the wall for most of the first half, former Cambridge forward Harvey Knibbs grabbed a brace and Smith scored an outrageous half-volley to seal the victory. This came after Hunt was forced to change three of his regular back four after illness struck Amadou Mbengue and Michael Craig missed out with a hamstring issue. \"I thought the game was a really good test for us in terms of how we defended as a team- everyone pulling together- because they had a spell at the start, and we defended it well,\" Hunt said. \"We talked about moments of quality in the final third- we had two in the first half. We want more but we understand the situation in the games. We get a corner, a second phase and we put the ball in the right area.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24827705.readingfc-boss-cambridge-united-win-sam-smith-strike/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18908270/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1735756527815}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1030582", "ttl": "Cambridge United old boys on target as Reading start 2025 with away victory", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Cambridge United old boys came back to haunt the relegation-threatened side as Harvey Knibbs and Sam Smith found the net in a 3-1 win for Reading. The pair departed the Abbey Stadium in 2023 to move to Berkshire and have become firm favourites with the Royals, and continued to endear themselves with the goals in the New Year's Day victory. The theme of the game was set from inside 60 seconds as Joel Pereira was forced into his first save of a busy first half- despite Reading kicking the game off. Dominated out wide throughout, with the Royalsâ€™ right taking a particular battering, the centre-back pairing of Bindon and Dean were the busiest men in Cambridge. Jordan Cousins and Smith were particularly keen to beat Pereira, both lining up multiple shots early on. It took eight minutes for Reading to muster an effort, Charlie Savage firing a shot well over the crossbar.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24827654.reading-fc-start-2025-big-away-win-cambridge-united/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18932145/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1735751761575}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1030589", "ttl": "Cambridge old boys do the damage for Reading", "oTtl": "Press Association", "pId": 32, "sum": "Harvey Knibbs (2) and Sam Smith were both on target for the Royals.", "cnUrl": "https://www.livescore.com/en/native/news/cambridge-old-boys-do-the-damage-for-reading-2025010117181631194/", "tnUrl": "https://image.assets.pressassociation.io/v2/image/production/d067860b7bb836c68397bde90497af92Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM1ODM4MDU5/2.78416158.jpg?rect=0,78,4000,2250&ext=.jpg", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1735751728000}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1030277", "ttl": "Reading team news: Noel Hunt makes two changes for New Year's Day Cambridge trip", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Reading boss Noel Hunt has made two changes for the New Year's Day trip to Cambridge United, with both full-backs changing.

Documents seen by The Guardian newspaper in October revealed that Dai Yongge's undisclosed debt to a Chinese state-backed bank has hindered his attempts to sell the club. The publication reported a loan from Haitong International Securities, secured against the club's stadium. The investment bank had the right to claim Reading's stadium if the debt is not repaid upon sale of the club, according to the documents. However, the club has now insisted that this debt has been cleared, by who remains unknown. Meanwhile, the update alluded to the pending court case from prospective buyer Rob Couhig, who is taking Renhe Sports Management to the High Courts for loss of earnings and breaching exclusivity, but 'will make no further comment.'", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/24825331.reading-fc-issue-latest-ownership-update-ahead-2025/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18722515/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1735640381356}]}
