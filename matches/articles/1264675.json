Clever in breaking up the play to make the spectacle poor for the viewer, when the ball was on the floor and in play it was all Boro from the off. Despite generally being second best, Reading had the first chance inside 20 minutes as the ball was worked from left to right and resulted in Chem Campbell flashing a cross at Murphy Cooper’s near post, forcing a Royal corner. Brandon Hanlan should have put the visitors ahead five minutes later, set free on the right and clear on goal but the Wycombe Wanderers loanee could only thrash his effort wide as Tyler Bindon closed him down from behind. Just on the other side of the half-hour mark, Dan Kemp had the best effort as he was found free in the box and while the top scorer caught his volley well, it was direct straight at Joel Pereira who made a good save. Lewis Wing, fresh from scoring on Tuesday, could have had his second in as many games as Jayden Wareham laid the ball back on the edge of the box but firing wide.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/25011163.stevenage-hold-reading-fc-draw-unbeaten-run-hits-10/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/19093943/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1742063481414}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1249266", "ttl": "'Two points dropped': Reading boss on 'frustrating' Stevenage and 'stonewall' penalty", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Reading boss Noel Hunt has labelled Saturday afternoon's 1-1 draw with Stevenage 'two points dropped.'
