Speaking after the win, Hunt said: \"I thought we looked really strong with a good structure. I thought the boys looked calm and mixed the game up well, which is what we’re looking for. I thought we were outstanding. Every man, to a tee, and the subs that came on.

An even start, Reading enjoyed plenty of the ball and knocked it around confidently after a trio of defeats in quick succession. Bolton looked comfortable and neither side looked too keen to play much football on what was a cloggy pitch by modern standards.
