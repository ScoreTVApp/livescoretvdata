Trailing by two at the break, one which was offside, the visitors pulled the score all-square with two goals in as many minutes. However, a low cross on the counter in stoppage time earned relegation-threatened Burton a third successive win. On the result, Hunt said: \"It is frustrating. The lad is two yards offside for the second goal- we hold the line well and have to rely on these officials to do their jobs properly because it’s costing us. We then have a stonewall penalty with Harvey on the wrong side of the defender not given and a free out given with a goalkeeper who has gone over himself and mistimed the jump.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24892884.reading-fc-boss-frustrating-stoppage-time-burton-defeat/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/19027202/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1738106070336}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1109666", "ttl": "Burton Albion net in stoppage time to inflict third straight defeat on Reading", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Reading suffered a third successive defeat, this time 3-2 at the hands of relegation threatened Burton Albion.
