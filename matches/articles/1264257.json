Goals from Sam Smith, Harvey Knibbs, Charlie Savage and Mamadi Camara ensured the Royals eased past the struggling Cobblers to move back into the top six and pick up a first win since Ruben Selles' exit to Hull City. Speaking after the game, Hunt said: \"I thought the boys were outstanding. From minute one we had the right mindset. We wanted to be front-footed and be in their half, which I thought we did really well. We turned them at times and the five up-front were really clear in what they were trying to achieve. I thought we were really strong at the back- I was disappointed with the goal we gave because it was a blatant handball, and it takes the clean sheet away from them. Overall, it was very pleasing. \"You have to keep going and doing the right things. There were moments where we thought we were comfortable, but at the same time I want us to keep doing the right things, the things that got us the two-goal lead and push on to get a goal earlier in the second half. They dug in and I thought they were outstanding.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24818934.reading-fc-boss-outstanding-northampton-town-win/?ref=rss&utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18857412/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1735237193307}, {"id": "pr:2998-a:1017806", "ttl": "Reading easy to victory as Kevin Nolan endures miserable start at Northampton", "oTtl": "Press Association", "pId": 32, "sum": "The hosts dominated much of the first half and led 2-0 at the break with goals from Harvey Knibbs and Sam Smith.", "cnUrl": "https://www.livescore.com/en/native/news/reading-easy-to-victory-as-kevin-nolan-endures-miserable-start-at-northampton-2024122617510989062/", "tnUrl": "https://image.assets.pressassociation.io/v2/image/production/e34b9fafac8c96a7b41ff35284b220ceY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM1MzE2MjE2/2.78423603.jpg?rect=0,78,1713,964&ext=.jpg", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1735235441000}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1017548", "ttl": "Birthday boy Hunt earns first win as Reading manager over struggling Northampton Town", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Reading beat Northampton Town 4-1 to earn a Boxing Day victory at the Select Car Leasing Stadium- a first for birthday boy Noel Hunt as manager. A comfortable afternoon for the play-off chasing Royals in front of a crowd of just over 12,000, goals from Harvey Knibbs, Sam Smith and Charlie Savage did the job. The Cobblers did improve after the break and Tom Eaves got on the scoresheet for Kevin Nolan's side in the former West Ham captain's first match as manager. It took only three minutes for an early nerves to be alleviated as Charlie Savage’s deep free-kick was not dealt with by the Cobblers and after a game of head tennis, Smith’s flick on was side-footed into the far corner by Knibbs to open the scoring. Firmly in control throughout the half, Joel Pereira had little to do as Northampton were unable to get anything going in the final third. Mbengue forced Nik Tzanev into a save after 15 minutes, but his floated, side-footed effort from distance was not a test for the shot stopper.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24818882.reading-fc-earn-first-win-birthday-boy-noel-hunt/?ref=rss&utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18918563/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1735232396249}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1017143", "ttl": "Reading team news: Amadou Mbengue returns for Northampton Town Boxing Day clash", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Reading boss Noel Hunt has made two changes for this afternoon's visit of Northampton Town, with Amadou Mbengue returning from the start.
