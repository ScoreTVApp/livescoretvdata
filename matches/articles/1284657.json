The visitors were well on top for most of the match, especially in a dominant first 45 minutes, only to go into the break losing after √ìscar Aranda pounced on Diogo Costa‚Äôs mistake on the stroke of half time. Porto equalised early in the second half through the inevitable Samu Aghehowa and the Spaniard seemed to have given the Dragons the lead when he finished off a brilliant counter-attack. However, the goal was disallowed and a penalty awarded to Famalic√£o for a handball infringement by Pepe in the Porto box at the start of the move, after intervention from the VAR. To add to the drama, Diogo Costa redeemed himself for his earlier mistake by brilliantly saving Aranda‚Äôs spot kick and there was no further scoring. Porto drop to third, level on points but behind Benfica on the head-to-head result, with just two points separating the duo from leaders Sporting.

The Eagles were drawn against German giants Bayern Munich, Australian outfit Auckland City and Argentina‚Äôs biggest club Boca Juniors. Benfica will play their three group games in Miami, Orlando and Charlotte. The 32-club tournament has been the subject of criticism with many commentators and protagonists from within the game complaining about the overload of matches for the world‚Äôs top players. FIFA has ploughed on regardless, as is their wont, and with the media platform DAZN screening all matches free of charge, it is likely to attract huge interest, especially without any competing major tournaments in the men‚Äôs game scheduled for next summer.
