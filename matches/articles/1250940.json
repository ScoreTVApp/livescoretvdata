Antoine Semenyo struck twice to clinch victory on what was otherwise a fairly forgettable afternoon. This is Bournemouth’s best-ever Premier League season, but somehow it has not felt like it lately. As recently as the end of February, they were fifth in the league, eyes firmly fixed on the Champions League places. But just two wins from 12 games before the visit of relegated Leicester extinguished any hope of a first European campaign for the Cherries next season.

And that team will be Brighton, just as long as they get at least a draw away to a team who have justifiably spent the last few days imbibing pints of 17 Year Itch. Should Spurs beat Brighton, Brentford will go above them if they win at Wolves. Chelsea win the Conference League and Chelsea finish seventh in the Premier League (which isn’t beyond the realms) or Chelsea finish sixth and Newcastle seventh. The latter is mathematically possible but let’s not go there again. Manchester City will qualify if they drew at Fulham. Mathematicians will tell you otherwise, but they need to live a little. If you said 420 to them the first think they’d think is ‘60 x 7', could also be 105 x 4’. Newcastle need to beat Everton to be sure of finishing in the top five. A draw will be enough if Aston Villa fail to win at Old Trafford or Chelsea draw at the City Ground. Chelsea must – must – beat Nottingham Forest at the City Ground to be sure. A draw will only be enough if Villa fail to win at Old Trafford or Newcastle suffer death by Moyes at St James’ Park. Aston Villa will qualify if they beat Man Utd and one of the following happens: Man City lose at Fulham, Newcastle fail to win, Chelsea fail to win. A draw could be good enough, but only in the sense that Donald Trump could wake up tomorrow morning with the temperament of the Dalai Lama. Nottingham Forest need to beat Chelsea and hope that Newcastle or Villa fail to win.
