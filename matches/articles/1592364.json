Aston Villa Women - Sun, Sep 7th 2025, 12:00 Aston Villa opened their 2025/26 Women’s Super League campaign with a hard-fought goalless draw at Brighton & Hove Albion. Both sides struck the woodwork during an evenly-balanced and keenly-contested encounter at Broadfield Stadium. Villa captain Rachel Daly saw her 25-yard strike hit the crossbar on the half-hour mark, while Anna Patten later got a crucial block to send Michelle Agyemang’s low effort on to the outside of a post. Debutant Lynn Wilms then came agonisingly close to securing all three points for Villa late on when her free-kick rebounded off the bar. A point apiece was a fair reflection and ensured the Villans, who finished last season with a club-record five consecutive WSL wins, got off the mark this term. Next up for Natalia Arroyo's side is the visit of reigning champions Chelsea to Villa Park next Sunday. Secure your seats now. The Villans, having enjoyed a positive pre-season, named summer signings Wilms, Océane Deslandes and Jill Baijings in their starting XI to face Albion. And a balanced start to the encounter saw both sides settle into the start of the campaign, Kiko Seike and Kirsty Hanson firing effort on target at either end in the opening exchanges. Sabrina D’Angelo was called upon to make a smart parried save from Rachel McLauchlan after 15 minutes, before Fran Kirby saw a close-range effort ruled out for offside. Daly came closest to breaking the deadlock in the first half as her right-footed strike from 25 yards rebounded off the crossbar. Kirby then fired across the face of goal as the Seagulls enjoyed a spell of pressure, while Hanson tested Chiamaka Nnadozie after Villa won possession in a dangerous area. And, following eight minutes injury time, the half-time whistle brought an end to a closely-fought first half. D’Angelo, having suffered an injury during the first half, was forced off at the break, replaced by Ellie Roebuck for her debut, while Rachel Maltby came on for Deslandes. And Maltby almost found the net with her first involvement early in the second half, only to be denied by Nnadozie. Brighton captain Maisie Symonds curled a 25-yard free-kick over the crossbar in the 53rd minute Sarah Mayling and Miri Taylor were introduced just after the hour mark, with the hosts going close to opening the scoring when Patten put in a great defensive block to deflect Agyemang’s low strike on to the outside of a post. Wilms produced a great block of her own to thwart Agyemang in the 77th minute, while Missy Bo Kearns volleyed over the crossbar for Villa. But it was the visitors who came closest to snatching all three points late on when Wilms’ 20-yard set-piece came back off the woodwork. Upcoming Fixtures Aston Villa Women Vs.
