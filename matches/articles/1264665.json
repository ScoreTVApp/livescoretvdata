Inside 10 minutes Camara charged down the keeper, with the former Swindon stopper mistiming his kick and delivering straight to Charlie Savage. Finding Billy Bodin in the box, the Burton Albion loanee was the latest of many to be flagged offside in a stop-start opening. The hosts certainly had half-chances but lacked a clinical nature, showing exactly why they sit second from bottom in League One. Former Nottingham Forest youngster Will Swann had a good individual game up against Abrefa, setting Tyreece John-Jules up in the box only for the forward to give away a throw-in with his attempted finish. Meandering along in the spring sunshine, Ehibhatiomhan gave the 1,400 supporters something to cheer about as his clever touch and finish on the half-hour mark opened the scoring. Reading got into the break with the slender lead but still gave away chances. John-Jules and Swann caused trouble in the right-hand channel but inviting crosses were flashed across the box with no takers in red.
