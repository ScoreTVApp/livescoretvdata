Falling behind in the second half, somewhat against the run of play, Jayden Wareham and Tyler Bindon turned the tie on its head to secure a sixth unbeaten match and keep up with the play-off challengers heading into the final 13 matches. Hunt, returning to the ground where he ended his playing career in 2018, said: \"It is what the boys have been made of [character] all the time I’ve been here. We keep getting stronger through games and keep going. At half-time I said how good we had been without being ‘us.’ At times in the first half, we moved the ball really well, but we got sucked into the slow game that they wanted to play, and I didn’t like it. When we upped the tempo, we got chance after chance. It was about not getting sucked into the opposition’s way of playing. We are young so it’s easily done but it’s about staying focused on what we did. I thought we were the better side.\"", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24974297.reading-fc-boss-praises-character-wigan-athletic-win/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/19136476/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1740853926745}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1207130", "ttl": "Reading defender set to miss the remainder of the season after injury", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Reading defender Michael Craig is likely to miss the rest of the season injured after picking up an injury.

Craig, a midfielder who has excelled at full-back all season, is now out for at least six to eight weeks, but could return should the Royals qualify for the end of season play-offs. \"Craigy is worse than we first thought,\" Hunt said in Wigan. Potentially he is going to miss the rest of the season- there is no point in dressing it up. I told him to keep his focus. This can be a really battling time, out of contract, but it could be a six-to-eight-week injury.
