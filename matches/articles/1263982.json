Unable to carve many clear-cut chances, the final whistle was met with boos from the sub-8,000 crowd at the SCL Stadium. Speaking to the media after the game, a third match unbeaten, Hunt said: \"We know we weren’t at our best tonight. Decision-making was different to what it was on Saturday. We’re frustrated but it’s a point, we take it and move on. It’s never going to be perfect every weekend, but you can sense the boys’ disappointment. \"Maybe our lack of bravery at times to get it down and play, we hooked on too many things we didn’t need to, and we needed the composure to find the out pass. We have shown them a few pictures on the TV, and it looks obvious but when you’re out there it’s a bit different.
