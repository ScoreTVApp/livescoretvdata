To do so, they had to win their game in hand on “the Pearl of the Atlantic” that had been interrupted due to fog two weeks ago. Resuming the game from the 15-minute mark when it had been abandoned in December, the home team, as in the initial match, took the game to Porto from the off. Just a couple of minutes had been played and Dudu Teodoro headed the islanders into the lead from a well worked attack, with Porto’s defence offering passive resistance. The inoffensive visitors were out-of-sorts for the rest of the first half and Nacional doubled their lead shortly before half time when Zé Vitor took advantage of more shocking marking to head in a corner. Porto improved in the second half but the damage had been done as Nacional dropped deeper and focused on protecting their lead and earning a vital three points that sees them move out of the relegation zone and jump four places up the table to 14th.
