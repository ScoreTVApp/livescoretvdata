Benfica thrashed Porto 4-1 at the Estádio do Dragão tonight. It was only the second time Benfica had scored four goals at the home of their fiercest rivals – the previous occasion was in 1943! The Eagles completely outplayed the hosts from start to finish. As well as the four goals, Benfica hit the post twice and had several other opportunities to pile on the misery for Porto supporters. Greek striker Vangelis Pavlidis was the hero of the night for the Lisbon outfit netting a hat-trick. Samu Aghehowa pulled one back for Porto, but Benfica captain Nicolas Otamendi put the cherry on the cake for the visitors to make it 4-1 – the same scoreline when the two teams met at the Estádio da Luz earlier this season. Benfica are in rude health, clocking up a 9th successive victory in the Primeira Liga as they continue firm in their fight for the title with Lisbon rivals Sporting. For Porto, it’s back to the drawing board with new president André Villas-Boas under increasing pressure.
