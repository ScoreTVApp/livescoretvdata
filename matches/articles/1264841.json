A clash lacking the usual quality, it was played in front of a passionate atmosphere as over 15,000 supporters turned out in glorious sunshine.

Wycombe certainly edged a fiery first-half, with Reading off the boil and failing to threaten Will Norris between the posts. It took two minutes for Joel Periera to be forced into a save as Knibbs’ misjudged back header fell to Adam Reach and his half-volley was flicked wide.
