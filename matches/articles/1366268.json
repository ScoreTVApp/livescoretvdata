Aston Villa - Tue, Jan 21st 2025, 18:45 Unai Emery says Aston Villa must remain excited and motivated in the UEFA Champions League after a tough loss to AS Monaco. The visitors dominated possession and had their chances at Stade Louis II but were undone by an eighth-minute goal from Wilfried Singo. Villa’s manager was positive about his team’s performance and is remaining upbeat ahead of the final game of the league phase against Celtic at Villa Park next week. “We played 70 minutes very well,” he said. “We conceded one goal because in the set pieces we weren’t working well defensively and even offensively were worse than defensively. We conceded one goal from a corner. “We had more options in our attack with our corners and we didn’t do very good. Playing the match for 70 minutes, more or less, we created chances to score. “In the match, for 70 minutes we were controlling the game like we planned before. We didn’t score but we were in a good way to get it. “In the last 20 minutes we lost a little bit our positioning on the field and we didn’t work really well with two strikers. This is our challenge and we have to get it.” The result moved Monaco level on points with Villa as several sides begin to make their final moves to get it into the top eight. Defeat in their penultimate league phase outing means Emery’s men will likely require a victory against Celtic and results elsewhere to go their way on matchday eight. He said: “In the Champions League we were contenders to be in the top eight, but now it will be very difficult to get the top eight. “We have to continue being excited and motivated. Here supporting us were a lot of fans from Birmingham, from Aston Villa, and I’m very thankful for them. “We have to keep going and enjoy the way we are doing in Champions League, even losing today.”", "cnUrl": "https://www.avfc.co.uk/news/2025/january/21/Emery--We-must-keep-going-in-the-Champions-League/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://img.gc.avfcservices.co.uk/fit-in/1000x1000/eab582f0-d81d-11ef-a732-c1ce955da895.jpg", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1737493175193}, {"id": "pr:4328-a:1087637", "ttl": "PLAYER RATINGS | Monaco 1-0 Aston Villa: Wilfried Singo leads hosts to first win of 2025", "oTtl": "Get French Football News", "athr": "Raphael Jucobin", "pId": 35, "sum": "Going into the penultimate matchday of their Champions League group stage campaign, Monaco had been winless since the turn of the year.
