Denmark could justify leaving the 33-year-old out of their squad for the meetings with Scotland and Greece on the basis he remains unemployed. Yet as Denmark huffed, puffed and failed to unpick a magnificently drilled Scotland defence, the issue of what Eriksen could have contributed was such an obvious one. Denmark in this form will not play at next summer’s World Cup. Steve Clarke’s Scotland were well worthy of their point. But for a lack of composure in front of goal, they would have departed Copenhagen with all three. The winners from this opening night of a truncated section were the Greeks, who swept Belarus aside, but Scotland richly deserved their full-time ovation from an appreciative support, while Denmark were booed off.

John Souttar and Grant Hanley also come into the back four. In midfield, Scott McTominay and Ryan Christie are in for Billy Gilmour and Lennon Miller, while Lyndon Dykes will play as a lone striker in front of Che Adams.
