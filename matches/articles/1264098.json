The former Championship winner was confirmed to take over from Ruben Selles on Friday, signing a two-and-a-half year deal after his five-game interim spell after Paul Ince in 2022. Drawing 1-1 with Wycombe Wanderers in his first match in charge, thoughts instantly turned to the January transfer window as fears of a repeat of last year were at the forefront of minds. In January 2024, the likes of Nelson Abbey, Tom McIntyre and Tom Holmes all departed without consent of the new Hull City boss Selles- with supporters protesting shortly after by invading the pitch and seeing a match against Port Vale abandoned.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24779401.reading-fc-boss-braced-january-departures/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18853523/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1733601964113}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:969181", "ttl": "New Reading boss on Wycombe Wanderers draw, penalty appeals and travelling supporters", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "New Reading boss Noel Hunt was left very happy having taken a point off League One leaders Wycombe Wanderers in his first match in charge. Harvey Knibbs scored in the first-half as the Royals held the Chairboys to a 1-1 draw at Adams Park less than 24 hours after Ruben Selles departed to Championship strugglers Hull City. Speaking to the media for the first time since taking the role on a two-and-a-half year deal, the former striker said: \"I think so [very good point away from home]. With the emotions running through the camp since Thursday, to go and put on performance like that in the conditions- you’ve got to be pleased.\" Only one change was made from Tuesday's 3-0 win over Cambridge United, with goal scorer Knibbs returning from the start. Speaking on the style and building on what Selles had started, Hunt added: \"If it isn’t break don’t fix it, just little bits of information on mindset. When things are a bit chaotic, can we take the sting out of it? Can we keep possession. I thought we did it really well in the last 10", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24779394.reading-fc-boss-wycombe-wanderers-draw-penalty-appeal/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18853509/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1733598501382}, {"id": "pr:2950-a:968897", "ttl": "Wycombe held at home by Reading", "oTtl": "Press Association", "pId": 32, "sum": "Harvey Knibbs earned the visitors a point.", "cnUrl": "https://www.livescore.com/en/native/news/wycombe-held-at-home-by-reading-2024120717525262527/", "tnUrl": "https://image.assets.pressassociation.io/v2/image/production/a00eafd73310b6051d925a1c4c23b4a0Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzMzNjgwMTU2/2.75168411.jpg?rect=0,472,1704,958&ext=.jpg", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1733593804000}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:968652", "ttl": "Reading take point off league leaders in first game under new boss Noel Hunt", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Charlie Savage kicked off and it was Reading who started the strongest without testing Franco Ravizzola in the net. Battling turgid conditions, it was not surprising to see a war of attrition on the field and a struggle for both sides to take any form of control in the game. Former Chairboy Lewis Wing tried his luck from distance, now a trademark for the captain, and a deflection forced the first corner of the match. Keeping the pressure on, the Royals forced multiple set pieces and another former Wycombe star, Chem Campbell, sent an effort wide of the post courtesy of a deflection. It took 16 minutes for the hosts to have their first effort, Aaron Morley fizzing over the crossbar from range, before Matt Bloomfield’s side took the lead shortly after. Jack Grimmer beat Jeriel Dorsett out wide and his cutback was converted by Lubala, who riled up the already frenzied away support with his celebration. Having lost their respected manager less than 24 hours before, some could have expected heads to drop. They certainly didn’t and on the half-hour mark Reading deservedly levelled the scores. Sam Smith raced onto the ball after a miscontrol in the Wycombe back line and although his effort was saved by Ravizzola, Knibbs was on hand to convert the rebound into an open net before celebrating in front of the sold-out Beachdean Terrace behind the goal. The weather played its part, Dan Harvie nearly seeing his pass nestle into the net after bouncing over Pereira, and Savage had the final Royal attempt of the half after letting fly from the edge of the box, unfortunately it was down the throat of the keeper and did not test the Argentine stopper.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24779317.reading-fc-take-point-off-wycombe-wanderers-noel-hunt-bow/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18831769/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1733590659086}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:968262", "ttl": "Reading team news: Noel Hunt names makes one change for Wycombe Wanderers test", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Reading legend Noel Hunt has named his first team sheet as manager of the club, naming an unchanged team for the trip to league leaders Wycombe Wanderers.
