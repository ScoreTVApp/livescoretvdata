The Stags, visiting the SCL Stadium for the first time ever, had beaten Peterborough United 3-0 on Boxing Day and were only a matter of two places behind the Royals. However, Mamadi Camara and Bindon goals either side of Will Evans' header were enough for back-to-back home wins under Noel Hunt. A scrappy start, neither side could appear to get the ball down and keep it which made for a constant flow of turnovers. It took six minutes for the first shot, with Lewis Wing toe-poking wide of the goal from the edge of the box. Both sides attempted to play football, and the Royals struggled to contend with the speed of passing from the in-form Stags at time. However, it was the hosts who took the lead on 17 minutes. Wing and Sam Smith combined in the midfield and Camara was threaded through on goal from halfway. With plenty of time to think about his finish while baring down on goal, the winger cleverly slotted past Christy Pym for his second goal in as many games.", "cnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/24822400.reading-fc-end-2024-play-offs-mansfield-town-victory/?utm_source=livescore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=foryou", "tnUrl": "https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/18924088/", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1735492763121}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1024178", "ttl": "Reading beat Mansfield to preserve strong home record", "oTtl": "Press Association", "pId": 32, "sum": "Mamadi Camara and Tyler Bindon scored in a 2-1 win.", "cnUrl": "https://www.livescore.com/en/native/news/reading-beat-mansfield-to-preserve-strong-home-record-2024122917143603306/", "tnUrl": "https://image.assets.pressassociation.io/v2/image/production/af785365f86cc2639b2a028f05afb668Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM1NTc4NjY5/2.75605062.jpg?rect=0,42,1549,871&ext=.jpg", "aiGen": false, "pbAt": 1735492398000}, {"id": "pr:3059-a:1023787", "ttl": "Reading team news: Noel Hunt names unchanged side for visit of Mansfield Town", "oTtl": "Reading Chronicle", "pId": 35, "sum": "Reading boss Noel Hunt has named an unchanged team for this afternoon's clash with Mansfield Town.
