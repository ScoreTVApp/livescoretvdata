Estoril came out fighting in the second half. The hosts missed a glorious chance to halve the deficit when Yanis Begrauoui’s penalty was saved by Anatoliy Trubin, but the home team did score in the 78th minute through a Vinícius Zanocelo header to set up a nervy ending for Benfica. The visitors held on though, and will go into next weekend’s crunch derby against Sporting – the penultimate game of the season – at worst level on points with their Lisbon neighbours.
